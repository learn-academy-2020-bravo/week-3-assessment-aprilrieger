# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  
  Your answer: I really do not know why we do this. I know how it goes when we declare the object as this.state we can then destructure.... Reasearching to understand better

  Researched answer: It's a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets into their own variable. It allows us to extract properties from an object or items from an array, multiple at a time. https://wesbos.com/destructuring-objects



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: value, index, array

  Researched answer: value, index, array: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: Objects are variables that have key value pairs. A class is the framework that holds all the information.

  Researched answer: Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/objects-in-javascript/

  A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: div is a container that holds code and span is tag that can be called in CSS to be styled. 

  Researched answer: The HTML <span> tag is used for grouping and applying styles to inline elements. There is a difference between the span tag and the div tag. The span tag is used with inline elements whilst the div tag is used with block-level content.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?


  Your answer: A place to house the JSX -- html behaving code.

  Researched answer: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: 1. When defining your main container wrap to be X amount of pixels wide and then creating a container to be width: 100%. 2. We can add breaking points through media queries in the CSS for different media sizes and types. 3. Using the CSS flexbox which is preconfigured to be responsive. 

  Researched answer: Pretty much the same thing I stated above : https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/responsive-website.html



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming: refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- irb: short for Interactive Ruby, is a quick way to explore the Ruby programming language and try out code without creating a file.
- Instance variable: is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol. An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data.
- Ruby hash: A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
- Class relationships:  In Ruby all values are objects and all objects belong to a class. The class defines what data and behavior exist in the object.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby: 
attr_accessor : This accessor generates the automatic Getter & Setter method for the given item.
attr_reader : This accessor generates the automatic Getter method for the given item.
attr_writer : This accessor generates the automatic Setter method for the given item.
